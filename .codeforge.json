It sets up a basic logging configuration that logs messages at different verbosity levels.\n- Each subcommand can have its own logging configuration, allowing for more granular control over what gets logged based on the command name or any additional arguments provided.\n\n### Usage:\n\nTo use this script, you would typically run it in a Python environment. You can specify various command-line options to customize its behavior:\n\nbash\npython codeforgeai/parser.py analyze --loop\n\n\nThis command will enable adaptive feedback loops for analyzing the working directory.\n\nThe script is designed to be simple and easy to understand, providing clear documentation of its functionality and commands.",

The script includes functionalities such as calling the general and code AI models, executing changes based on user prompts, and loading default configuration settings from a JSON file.\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Functionality Breakdown**:\n   - **Console Scripts**: The script can run as a console application by uncommenting the `console_scripts` section in `setup.cfg`.\n   - **User Input**: The script allows users to input user prompts and execute them using the command line.\n   - **Configuration Management**: It reads configuration settings from a JSON file, which is optional for production environments.\n\n2. **Logging**:\n   - Logs are set up to include timestamp, log level, module name, message, and more.\n\n3. **Execution Flow**:\n   - The script processes user prompts and calls the appropriate AI model.\n   - It also includes logic to execute changes based on the user's input.\n   - The changes are printed in a formatted manner for demonstration purposes.\n\n4. **Dependencies**:\n   - The script requires the `codeforgeai` library, which is expected to be installed using pip (`pip install codeforgeai`). You can add it via a command like `pip install .`.\n\n### Usage:\n- Save the file as `src/codeforgeai/skeleton.py`.\n- Create a JSON file named `.codeforgeai.json` in the same directory as your script, containing initial configuration settings. For example:\n  json\n  {\n      \"general_model\": \"ollama_general\",\n      \"general_prompt\": \"Based on the below prompt and without returning anything else, restructure it so that it is strictly understandable to a coding ai agent with json output for file changes:\",\n      \"code_model\": \"ollama_code\",\n      \"code_prompt\": \"in very clear, concise description of the code\"\n  }\n  \n- Run your script from the command line:\n  sh\n  python -m src.codeforgeai.skeleton\n  \n\nThis setup provides a basic framework for interacting with a custom code AI model and can be expanded with additional features as needed.",
