It specifies the package name, version, author details, packages to include, and any additional requirements. The `install_requires` parameter is used to specify any dependencies that are required for the project to run smoothly.\n\nTo use this setup script, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a virtual environment**: Before running the installation command, you need to create a virtual environment where your project will be installed.\n   bash\n   python -m venv venv\n   \n\n2. **Activate the virtual environment**: Activate the virtual environment so that Python packages can be installed and run from within it.\n   bash\n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   \n\n3. **Install the project using pip**: Use pip to install your project in the virtual environment.\n   bash\n   pip install .\n   \n\n4. **Run tests**: After installing the project, you can run any tests to ensure everything is working as expected.\n   bash\n   python -m unittest discover\n   \n\n5. **Create a new pull request**: If you have completed the setup steps and are ready to create a new pull request, follow these steps:\n   - Click on the \"New Pull Request\" button in your GitHub repository.\n   - Select the branch that contains the updated code from the dropdown menu.\n   - Provide a title for your pull request, including a brief description of what the changes are.\n   - Add any necessary files or images to accompany your pull request.\n   - Click \"Create Pull Request\" to submit your pull request.\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully set up and use the `codeforgeai` project on GitHub.",

        "././docs/conf.py": "To complete the script, you need to write code that integrates with the Sphinx documentation system. Here's a basic outline of how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Set Up Sphinx**: Ensure that Sphinx is installed and configured correctly in your Python environment.\n\n2. **Configure Configuration Files**: Modify your Sphinx configuration files (like `conf.py`) to include settings for your project.\n\n3. **Add Documentation Pages**: Create documentation pages in the appropriate sections of your Sphinx document.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Install Sphinx\n\nIf you haven't already, install Sphinx using pip:\nbash\npip install sphinx\n\n\n### Step 2: Configure Your Sphinx Configuration Files\n\nCreate or modify `conf.py` in the root directory of your project. Here's a basic example configuration:\n\npython\n# Importing necessary modules from Sphinx\nfrom docutils.core import publish_command\nimport os\nimport sys\n\n# The name of the project\nproject = 'codeforgeai'\nversion = sys.version_info[0:2]\n\n# Directory containing source files\nsource_dir = 'docs'\n\n# List of directories to exclude from documentation\nexclude_dirs = ['tests']\n\n# Document class options\nhtml_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'\nautodoc_default_flags = ['members', 'undocumented-members']\nadd_module_directories = [source_dir]\n\n# Custom command line for building HTML files\npublish_command('build')\n\n# Command to run Sphinx and generate documentation\nprint(f\"Running Sphinx...\")\n\n# Build the documentation\nbuild_cmd = publish_command(\n    \"build\",\n    clean=True,\n    dry_run=False,\n)\n\n# Running the build command\nos.system(build_cmd)\n\n\n### Step 3: Add Documentation Pages\n\nCreate or modify `docs/index.rst` in the root directory of your project. Here's a simple example:\n\nrst\n.. codeforgeai documentation master file, generated by Sphinx.\n\nWelcome to the codeforgeai documentation! This is the user guide for using the codeforgeai library and its components.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the `codeforgeai` package, you can use pip:\nbash\npip install codeforgeai\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nHere's an example of a basic page:\n\nrst\n.. codeforgeai documentation page\n===============================\n\nThis is a simple codeforgeai page. It provides a basic overview of how to use the library.\n\n### Installing the Library\n\nTo install the `codeforgeai` package, you can use pip:\nbash\npip install codeforgeai\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nHere's an example of how to use the library:\n\npython\nfrom codeforgeai import Client\n\n# Initialize a client with your API key\nclient = Client(api_key='your_api_key')\n\n# Use the client to perform operations\nresponse = client.some_function()\nprint(response)\n\n\n### Customization\n\nYou can customize the appearance and behavior of your documentation pages by modifying the templates in the `templates` directory.\n\n### Deployment\n\nTo deploy your documentation, you can use a static site generator like GitHub Pages or Bitbucket Pages.\n\nbash\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\ngit push origin master\n\n\nBy following these steps and setting up your Sphinx configuration files, you should be able to create a comprehensive and user-friendly documentation for the `codeforgeai` library.",
