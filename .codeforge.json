        "docs/conf.py": "The code provided is a setup for configuring Sphinx, a documentation generator for Python. Here's a breakdown of the key components and their functionalities:\n\n### 1. Installation\n\nFirst, ensure that you have `sphinx` installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install sphinx\n```\n\n### 2. Configuration Files\n\n- **conf.py**: This file contains the main configuration settings for Sphinx.\n- **docs/conf.py**: This file is a configuration file for your Sphinx project, specifying documentation directories and other settings.\n\n#### `conf.py`\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how you might set up a basic configuration:\n\n```python\n# conf.py\n\nextensions = [\n    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',\n    'sphinx.ext.mathjax',\n    # Add more extensions as needed\n]\n\nautodoc_dir = 'docs'\nautodoc_exclude_pattern = r'^\\.git'\n\nmathjax_config = {\n    \"loader\": \"path/to/tex2jax\",\n    \"display_inline\": True,\n}\n\nlatex_engine = 'xelatex'\nlatex_conf = {\n    \"documentclass\": \"article\",\n    \"outputlangs\": [\"en\"],\n}\n```\n\n#### `docs/conf.py`\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how you might configure your project:\n\n```python\n# docs/conf.py\n\nproject = \"Your Project Name\"\nversion = \"1.0\"\nrelease = \"1.0\"\n\nextensions = [\n    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',\n    'sphinx.ext.mathjax',\n    # Add more extensions as needed\n]\n\nautodoc_dir = 'docs'\nautodoc_exclude_pattern = r'^\\.git'\n\nmathjax_config = {\n    \"loader\": \"path/to/tex2jax\",\n    \"display_inline\": True,\n}\n\nlatex_engine = 'xelatex'\nlatex_conf = {\n    \"documentclass\": \"article\",\n    \"outputlangs\": [\"en\"],\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Building Documentation\n\nTo build documentation, you can use the `make` command:\n\n```bash\nmake html\n```\n\nThis will generate HTML documentation in a directory named `docs/build/html`.\n\n### 4. Customization\n\nYou can customize Sphinx by adding more extensions or modifying existing ones. Here\u2019s how you might add an extension that uses Mathjax:\n\n```python\n# conf.py\n\nextensions = [\n    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',\n    'sphinx.ext.mathjax',\n    # Add more extensions as needed\n]\n\nmathjax_config = {\n    \"loader\": \"path/to/tex2jax\",\n    \"display_inline\": True,\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Customizing LaTeX Configuration\n\nIf you want to customize the output of your documentation in a LaTeX environment, you can modify the `latex_conf` dictionary:\n\n```python\n# conf.py\n\nlatex_engine = 'xelatex'\nlatex_conf = {\n    \"documentclass\": \"article\",\n    \"outputlangs\": [\"en\"],\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Directory Structure\n\nSphinx projects typically use a directory structure where each section contains a set of documentation files. Here\u2019s how you might organize your project:\n\n- `docs/`\n  - `build/`\n    - `html/`\n      - `index.html` (main index file)\n  - `source/`\n\n### 7. Additional Options\n\nYou can add more options to customize Sphinx, such as the use of external documentation or custom themes:\n\n```python\n# conf.py\n\nextensions = [\n    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',\n    'sphinx.ext.mathjax',\n    # Add more extensions as needed\n]\n\nmathjax_config = {\n    \"loader\": \"path/to/tex2jax\",\n    \"display_inline\": True,\n}\n\nlatex_engine = 'xelatex'\nlatex_conf = {\n    \"documentclass\": \"article\",\n    \"outputlangs\": [\"en\"],\n}\n```\n\n### 8. Deployment\n\nFinally, you can deploy your documentation by creating an HTML file (`index.html`) and placing it in a directory named `docs/build/html/`. You can then serve this static files using your web server.\n\nThis setup provides a basic foundation for building a comprehensive documentation site with Sphinx. You can further customize the configuration and integrate additional features as needed for your project.",

        "src/codeforgeai/cli.py": "The file `src/codeforgeai/cli.py` is a Python script that handles various commands for interacting with the CodeforgeAI AI agent. The script reads command-line arguments, processes them, and utilizes the `codeforgeai.engine`, `codeforgeai.parser`, and `codeforgeai.config` modules to perform the required operations. Here's a breakdown of what this script does:\n\n1. **Import necessary modules**:\n   - `sys`: Contains environment variables and file handling.\n   - `logging`: Handles logging output.\n   - `os`: Provides operating system-related functions.\n   - `codeforgeai.engine`: Contains the main logic of the AI agent.\n   - `codeforgeai.parser`: Parses user input prompts.\n   - `codeforgeai.config`: Ensures configuration files are correct and loads them.\n\n2. **Setup logging**:\n   - A basic logger is configured to output logs at different levels (`INFO`, `DEBUG`, etc.).\n\n3. **Parse command-line arguments**:\n   - The script uses `argparse` to define a simple interface for handling various commands.\n   - It parses the provided arguments and sets up the logging level based on the user's input.\n\n4. **Main function**:\n   - If no command is specified, it prompts the user to provide valid input.\n   - Depending on the command, it performs the required action (analyze, prompt, strip), using the `codeforgeai.engine` for handling the logic and parsing of inputs.\n\n5. **Execution**:\n   - The script runs the main function when executed from the command line.\n\nThis script provides a flexible way to interact with the CodeforgeAI AI agent, making it easy to manage user commands and ensure that the application behaves as expected.",
        "src/codeforgeai/config.py": "Based on the content and structure provided, this file is classified as a `source control file`. The file contains JSON data that defines various configurations for different software development environments or projects. The key points include:\n1. `create_default_config` function: This is responsible for creating a default configuration file with predefined values.\n2. `load_config` function: This loads the configuration from a specified path and updates it if necessary.\n3. `ensure_config_prompts` function: This ensures that all necessary prompt keys are present in the configuration, appending missing ones with default values.\n\nOverall, this file serves as a foundational structure for managing software development settings and configurations, aiding developers to automate tasks and streamline their workflow by providing consistency across different environments or projects.",
        "src/codeforgeai/directory.py": "This script is designed to classify files in a given directory structure based on the content of their respective code. It uses Gitignore patterns to ignore directories and files that match those patterns.\n\n1. **Initialization**: The script starts by defining some helper functions:\n   - `get_relative_path`: Converts a full path from the root directory to an appropriate relative path.\n   - `parse_gitignore`: Parses a string of Gitignore patterns into a list of strings.\n   - `remove_ignored`: Recursively removes files and directories that match any of the ignored patterns.\n   - `is_ignored`: Checks if a given file or directory should be ignored based on its name, content type, and ignored patterns.\n\n2. **File Classification**: The script iterates over each item in the tree data structure:\n   - For each item, it checks for files (`{'type': 'file'}`) and directories (`{'type': 'directory'}`). It uses Gitignore to filter out any files that match patterns.\n   - If a file matches, it attempts to classify it using the `classify_files` function. The function maps relative paths to their respective classifications (e.g., \"Python\", \"JavaScript\").\n\n3. **Output**: Finally, the script outputs the classified classifications for all files and directories in the specified directory.\n\n### Note:\n- Ensure that the script is run from a directory containing valid Gitignore patterns.\n- Paths are relative to the root of the directory structure.\n- The `classify_files` function requires an instance of `CodeModel`, which is typically defined elsewhere in your codebase.",
