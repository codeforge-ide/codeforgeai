CLI Command Reference
ZerePy provides a comprehensive set of CLI commands. Use help to see all available commands at any time.

Agent Management
list-agents - Display all available agents
load-agent - Load a specific agent for use
agent-loop - Start the agent's autonomous behavior
agent-action - Execute a single agent action
chat - Start an interactive chat session with the agent
Connection Management
list-connections - Show all available platform connections
list-actions - Display available actions for a specific connection
configure-connection - Set up a new platform connection
Additional Commands
help [command] - Get detailed help for a specific command
exit or quit - Exit the ZerePy CLI
clear or cls - Clear the terminal environment
Blockchain Commands
Common Commands (All Chains)
Check native token balance:
get-eth-balance (Ethereum)
get-sonic-balance (Sonic)
get-balance (Solana)
Get token data by ticker: get-token-by-ticker
Send native tokens:
send-eth (Ethereum)
send-sonic (Sonic)
transfer (Solana)
EVM Chain Commands (Ethereum & Sonic)
Send tokens:
send-eth-token (Ethereum)
send-sonic-token (Sonic)
Get wallet address: get-address
Chain-Specific Commands
Solana Only
trade - Swap tokens using Jupiter
stake - Stake SOL
get-tps - Get current network TPS
get-token-by-address - Get token data by address
Sonic Only
swap-sonic - Swap tokens on DEX with custom slippage control
Note: EVM chains (Ethereum and Sonic) follow similar command patterns, just replace "eth" with "sonic" in the command name. For example: send-eth-token on Ethereum becomes send-sonic-token on Sonic chain.

EVM Integration
Send native transactions (ETH/MATIC)
Send ERC-20 tokens
Check wallet balances
Get token information
Execute token swaps
Support multiple networks (Ethereum, Polygon)
Custom gas settings
Contract interactions
Example Usage Flows
Basic Usage Flow
Start ZerePy
Use list-connections to check available platforms
Configure required connections using configure-connection [platform]:
# LLM Providers
configure-connection [openai|anthropic|eternalai|xai|ollama|hyperbolic|together|groq]

# Social Platforms
configure-connection [twitter|farcaster|discord|echochambers]

# Blockchain
configure-connection [solana|evm|sonic]

# Additional Tools
configure-connection goat    # for onchain actions
configure-connection allora  # for inference


Load your agent with load-agent
Start autonomous behavior with agent-loop
Interactive Usage
Load your agent
Use chat to interact directly with the agent
Use agent-action to trigger specific behaviors
Monitoring
The agent will log its actions and thought process
Use Ctrl+C to safely stop the agent loop at any time
Check the console output for success/failure messages
Server Mode Features

Remote agent control
Status monitoring
Action execution
Connection management
Starting Server Mode
python main.py --server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

Available Endpoints
